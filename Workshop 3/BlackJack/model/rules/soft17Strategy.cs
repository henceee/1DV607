     * Soft 17 means that the dealer has 17 but in a combination of Ace and 6 (for example Ace, two, two, two).
     * This means that the Dealern can get another card valued at 10 but still have 17 as the value of the ace 
     * is reduced to 1. Using the soft 17 rule the dealer should take another card 
     * (compared to the original rule when the dealer only takes cards on a score of 16 or lower).
